# weather_app_with_flutter

This project is a part of my university academic assignment.

## Getting Started

This is the starte versino of this app. I have some plan to enrich this app with more functionality.

A few resources to learn flutter.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
